This was a collaborative effort by Team LeBalloon for the 2025 spring semester freshman course 'CSE 1012: Stratospheric Ballooning' at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

The PICOLO flight code modified by Team LeBalloon is utilized to determine the relationship between the thrust generated by a propeller and its altitude of operation. The code also records data from a variety of sensors such as internal and external temperature, air pressure, acceleration, etc. For a more detailed list of the variables being recorded, refer to the PICOLOv1 flight code. The two variables that were added to Team LeBalloon's edition of the flight code are propeller throttle percentage and thrust which was initially recorded as arbitrary units. To convert the thrust readings into more practical units (pounds), the thrust readings were multiplied by a constant of roughly 5 * 10^-6 lbs. This value was obtained by weighing known weighs on the test stand and comparing them to the "thrust" readings on the serial monitor.

The PICOLO flight computer was designed and provided to Team LeBalloon by the faculty. It consisted of a Raspberry Pico which was connected to multiple sensors and actuators:
 - BNO055 - An smart sensor with a built in accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer
 - MS5611 - A pressure sensor
 - NEO M8N GPS - A GPS
 - SSD1306 - An OLED screen that displays select data being read by the PICOLO
 - SPI SD Card Reader - An SD card reader to which data recorded by the PICOLO is written to

A Dragon Touch Vision 3 Action Camera was attached to the payload which would capture footage throughout the flight. Each team can position their cameras in unique ways to capture different perspectives of the flight and Team LeBalloon positioned their camera on the top of their payload, facing diagonally upwards towards the propeller. The purpose of this was to observe the functioning of the propeller during flight. The camera was fastened by making a hole in the top of the box and sliding it in at an angle that faces the propeller (roughly 45 degrees). The camera was then fastened by two zip-ties which wrapped around it, piercing the top of the box.

To ensure that the payload had enough power to last the entire flight, four batteries were used: three 5V Actionheat batteries and one LiPo battery. One Actionheat battery was used to power the PICOLO, one was used to power the camera, and one was used to power a heater mesh that ensured that the other two batteries were not damaged by the low temperatures of the upper atmosphere. The LiPo battery was used to power the ESC motor. It is worth mentioning that the LiPo battery is capable of back feeding through the motor - powering both the motor and the PICOLO.

The payload was designed using Styrofoam sheets in which the PICOLO and the batteries were placed in with the test stand on top of the payload box. The entire box was then enclosed by a cage made up of PVC pipes (dubbed "The Bernoulli Cage") through which the rigging was done. This was to ensure that none of the rigging lines would get caught by the propeller during flight - which could lead to unfavorable damage.
Team LeBalloon also incorporated their own sensors and actuators to suit the needs of their testing and experimentation:
 - HX711 - A load cell responsible for recording the applied thrust on the test stand by the propeller
 - 30 Amp Brushless ESC DC Motor - A motor which spun the propeller
 - LEDs - Four LEDs of colors blue, green, yellow, and red to indicate the current throttle percentage of the motor

The final payload weighed roughly 4 lbs and was the heaviest payload in the class being flown. Below are schematics and images of the final payload structure and design:
