This was a collaborative effort by Team LeBalloon for the 2025 spring semester freshman course 'CSE 1012: Stratospheric Ballooning' at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

The PICOLO flight code modified by Team LeBalloon is utilized to determine the relationship between the thrust generated by a propeller and its altitude of operation. The code also records data from a variety of sensors such as internal and external temperature, air pressure, gyroscopy, acceleration, etc. For a more detailed list of the variables being recorded, refer to the PICOLOv1 flight code. The 2 variables that were added to Team LeBalloon's edition of the flight code are propeller throttle percentage, and thrust which was intially recorded as arbitrary units. To convert the thrust readings into more practical units (pounds), the thrust readings were multiplied by a constant of roughly 5 * 10^-6 lbs. This value was obtained by weighing known weighs on the test stand and comparing them to the "thrust" readings on the serial monitor.

The PICOLO flight computer was designed and provided to Team LeBalloon by the faculty. It consisted of a Raspberry Pico which was connected to multiple sensors and actuators:
 - BNO055 - An smart sensor with a built in accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnometer
 - MS5611 - A pressure sensor
 - NEO M8N GPS - A GPS
 - SSD1306 - An OLED screen that displays select data being read by the PICOLO
 - SPI SD Card Reader - An SD card reader to which data recorded by the PICOLO is written to

Team LeBalloon also incorporated their own sensors and actuators to suit the needs of their testing and experimentation:
 - HX711 - A load cell responsible for recording the applied thrust on the test stand by the propeller
 - 30 Amp Brushless ESC DC Motor - A motor which spun the propeller
 - LEDs - Four LEDs of colors blue, green, yellow, and red to indicate the current throttle percentage of the motor
